# cal

Personal calendar CLI with server sync.

## Install

```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/fs0c-sh/cal.git
```

## Usage

```bash
calendar --help
calendar --sync --host <server> --port <port>
```

`--sync` connects to your calendar server, sends a `HELLO` line, then applies
the event updates the server pushes. On machines that reach the network
through an HTTP proxy, the connection is tunnelled with `CONNECT` using the
standard `http_proxy` / `https_proxy` / `all_proxy` variables. Updates are plain JSON (one event per
line) and are stored under `~/.local/share/cal/`. Nothing pushed is executed.

Events may carry attachments (venue maps, agendas) which are stored under
`~/.local/share/cal/attachments/`.

Reminder notes support simple mail-merge substitution for the standard
fields — a note like `Meeting {{ title }} at {{ start }}` is filled in with
plain string replace, no templating engine. Fired reminders are reported
back to the server as delivery receipts so it can verify how the reminder
displayed on the client.

## Development

```bash
pip3 install -e .
python3 -m pytest tests/
```
